# README

This Github Organization is dedicated to hosting the source code produced as part of the Ted AI Hackhaton 2023 in collaboration with the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://l.lfaidata.foundation)

Recommendations for participants:
1. [Secure your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) with two-factor authentication.
2. Adopt an [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/) for your project.
3. Ensure that every repo includes a LICENSE.md file that contains the license text.
4. Add a README.md file to your repo explaining why the project is useful and how to get started.
5. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file to your repos explaining to other developers and your community of users how to contribute to the project. At a high level, the file would explain what types of contributions are needed and how the process works.
6. Add a CODEOWNERS.md file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

If you decide to continue with the project beyond the hackathon:
7. Add a SUPPORT.md file to let users and developers know how to get help with your project. 
8. Setup issue templates and pull request templates that help you customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository.
9. Achieve and maintain the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge for your project.
10. Include an SPDX short-form identifier in a comment at the top of each file in the repo, wherever reasonably possible.
