# README

This Github Organization is dedicated to hosting the source code produced as part of the Ted AI Hackhaton 2023 in collaboration with the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://l.lfaidata.foundation)

### Recommendations for participants:

* [Secure your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) with two-factor authentication.
* Adopt an [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/) for your project.
* Ensure that every repo includes a LICENSE.md file that contains the license text.
* Add a README.md file to your repo explaining why the project is useful and how to get started.
* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file to your repos explaining to other developers and your community of users how to contribute to the project. At a high level, the file would explain what types of contributions are needed and how the process works.
* Add a CODEOWNERS.md file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

### If you decide to continue with the project beyond the hackathon:
* Add a SUPPORT.md file to let users and developers know how to get help with your project. 
* Setup issue templates and pull request templates that help you customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository.
* Achieve and maintain the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge for your project.
* Include an SPDX short-form identifier in a comment at the top of each file in the repo, wherever reasonably possible.
