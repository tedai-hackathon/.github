# Code of Conduct
We invite you to come to TED in a spirit of curiosity, friendliness, open-mindedness, and respect. We will not tolerate harassment, in any form, at a TED event or on a TED-hosted online event.

### At a TED event, you agree to:
* Respect the boundaries of other attendees.
* Avoid aggressively pushing your own services, products or causes.
* Respect confidentiality requests by speakers and other attendees.
* Look out for one another.
* Contribute to an inclusive event experience through respectful interactions with all TED attendees.

### These behaviors don't belong at a TED event:
* Invasion of privacy, including taking photos, requesting selfies of people you don't know, taking screenshots of conversations or posting personal details about someone else without their permission.
* Being disruptive, drinking excessively, stalking, following or threatening anyone.
* Abuse of power (including abuses related to position, wealth, race or gender).
* Ignoring health or safety guidelines that place yourself or others at risk.
* Homophobia, racism or behavior that discriminates against a group or class of people.
* Sexual harassment of any kind, including unwelcome sexual attention and inappropriate physical contact.

### Contact us to report an incident
If, while at a TED event, you have been involved or have witnessed an incident that violates the Code of Conduct, please use our [name-optional reporting form](https://go.ted.com/report) to let key TED managers know immediately. Share as much information as you can to help us make a thorough investigation of the onsite incident.

### TED's commitment
TED will investigate all incidents reported at an event with discretion and confidentiality. TED reserves the right to bar any person who violates our Code of Conduct from attending TED in its entirety or in part, and/or to cancel the membership of the person without refund.
